	<section class="job">
            <h2>Current/Recent Job</h2>
	    <p>I used to work at a pumpkin patch in Homer Glen. There I was a ride operator, I would operate the rides and make sure everyone was safe. I currently work at a grocery store where I unload trucks and bring pallets out to the sales floor. Work there also allowed me to learn how to use the forklift and I am now certified to use forklifts for the store. </p>
